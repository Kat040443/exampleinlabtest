# Collaboration and Accessibility
# All team members have access to the latest code and can synchronise changes automatically.
# Branching and merging allows for isolated development without impacting the main code, supporting sade integration of
# new features or fixes.

# Version Control
# Remote repositories provide a history of changes, enabling a return to previous versions when needed.
# Team members ca retrieve older code versions or restore previously removed code, supporting better code management and accountability.

# Redundancy and Backup
# Remote repositories act as a backup, securing the code and ensuring it's accessible even if local copies are lost or compromised.
# Devs can quickly resume work by re=cloning the repository.
